# Patternish.

This is a mashup between Brad Frost's [ish](https://github.com/bradfrost/ish.) and his [Pattern Lab](https://github.com/bradfrost/patternlab/), and some of my own ideas. I copied the resize functionality from patternlab, because it's much more powerful and clever. You'll now be able to resize the iFrame by hand, and you can use the brilliant Hay-mode, to name a few improvements). And I added two of my own little ideas: a bookmarklet (hooray!) which passes the URL *and* the title of the page you want to view in ish. This is especially handy when presenting more than one tab with ish-instances in them. I know, marginal, but this is my margin.
